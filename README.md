# xmlPrivacy

Here i tried to apply normal masking, swapping and RSA algorithm for hiding the important data in an xml file.

data masking is done in an python file.
beautifulsoup ,lxml, argparser packages are needed.Install them and run the python file.

Tomcat server is needed for rendering the web pages.

finally change the path in controller, its compulsory(give tomcats bin folder path, its working properly).
